# heartdiseasepredection
St.Peters college demo

This repository is a one off fork from the Microsoft ML.NET Samples. THe ML.NET samples is too big and has dependencies on
common code and Nuget package definitions. This is extracted out of the repo to be self contained. I did this for demoing
Binary Classification for Heart Disease predection.

When i just copied the the files from the repository it didn't build. I have to remove the references of ML.NET and ML.NET.FastTree
and add the latest version of them. The Datasets are same as what was already there.
